<h1>The Best Movies According to Altamash </h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Shoot out at Wadala</h3>
<p>In the film, Manya, a diligent student, lands in prison for killing a gangster who attacked his brother, Bhargav, who eventually dies. Soon, Manya escapes jail and forms his own gang to seek revenge. </p>
<p> Based on the book Dongri to Dubai: Six Decades of the Mumbai Mafia by Hussain Zaidi, the film dramatises the encounter by Bombay police in which gangster Manya Surve was shot dead. It took place at the junction adjacent to Dr. Ambedkar College, Wadala, Bombay on 11 January 1982.</p>
<h3>Ironman </h3>
<p>The first Iron Man film was intense, right from the get go. When I dragged my wife to watch it with me, the first 20 minutes had her going “I was expecting light & fluffy comic book movie, this”</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>Avengers: Infinity War,

    Part 1 of this most ambitious, larger than life attempt to depict a heist showing an ever supreme antagonist climb his way to d summit of world domination n annihilation succeeds not only as a visual spectacle but also has a satisfying emotional quotient to it...
    D expectations were magnanimous & so were d stakes, but hats off to d Russos' in ticking almost every box possible with a healthy mix of humor n sentiment</p>
